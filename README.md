> **Efficient API scaffold project for building microservices with .NET 8, leveraging Clean Architecture, Domain-Driven Design (DDD), and MediatR**. This project provides a highly extensible foundation for creating robust and scalable services with best practices in mind. üéØ

---

## üéØ Overview

This repository serves as a scaffold for creating efficient .NET microservices. Designed with modularity and maintainability in mind, it provides a strong starting point for enterprise-grade applications. The project is based on:

- üèó **Clean Architecture**: Encourages separation of concerns, making it easy to test, maintain, and expand.
- üì¶ **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**: Helps structure complex business logic with domain-specific layers.
- üì° **MediatR**: Facilitates communication between components using the mediator pattern for cleaner, decoupled code.

---

## üõ† Features

- **Modular Structure**: Provides organized layers for domain, application, and infrastructure.
- **Highly Extensible**: Easily add new features and components without affecting the core structure.
- **Efficient Performance**: Optimized codebase for responsive microservice applications.
- **Best Practices**: Follows .NET and architectural best practices for clean and maintainable code.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [.NET 8 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/8.0)
- [SQL Server](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-downloads) (or another compatible database)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) (optional for containerized development)

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/APOCALO/ScaffoldingMS.git
   cd ScaffoldingMS
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   - Restore the dependencies by running:
     ```bash
     dotnet restore
     ```

3. **Configure the Database**:
   - Update `appsettings.json` with your database connection string.
   - Run migrations to set up the initial database schema:
     ```bash
     dotnet ef database update
     ```

4. **Run the Application**:
   ```bash
   dotnet run
   ```

## üìñ Usage

This scaffold is designed to support rapid API development. You can start creating new features by defining them in the **Domain** and **Application** layers, then exposing them through the **API** layer.

- **Adding New Endpoints**: Define new endpoints by adding request/response DTOs in `Application` and handlers with MediatR.
- **Extending the Domain**: Organize business logic within the `Domain` layer for reusability and consistency.

Refer to the [API Documentation](#) üìÑ for a detailed list of available endpoints and usage examples.
